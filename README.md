This is my submission for Unit 7 project.

It's the fully functional web dashboard. The app is built with mobile-first approach so it is responsive through all the resolutions

It includes Chartist.js plugin for displaying charts and CSS TOGGLE SWITCH for altering the apperance of switches.

It uses the JavaScript "send" a message and it allows to save settings using sessionStorage.
